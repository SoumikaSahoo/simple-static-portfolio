My First Portfolio Website
This is my second project and also my first personal portfolio, built using basic HTML and CSS.
It’s a simple, clean page that introduces me as a digital designer and highlights my skills.

The site includes:

A hero section with my name and location.

An about section with social media links.

A “What I Do” section explaining my work.

This project helped me practice layout design, typography, and basic styling while building something personal.

Tech Used: HTML5, CSS3
